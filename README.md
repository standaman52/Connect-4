This game was built using JavaScript, Jquery, HTML and CSS. I created my board using a div and filled it with an html 5 element called a canvas. I declared an ID on the canvas which allowed me to access the elements in Jquery. I began coding in JavaScript by building a function called placechip which was basically the main component of my code. I had a difficult time trying to solve the alogrithm of connect four so I ended up hard coding the different wining casses and putting them into an array.
